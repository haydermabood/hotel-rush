I wanted to create a simple while efficient and secure Node.js static resources and API server. For efficiency, I added the ability to compress server communication. For security, I added the ability to force SSL URL when accessing the website.

Server API can easily be expanded to support more offer and other entities management calls.

A test case added to examine the GET offers calls for different aspects of the returned data, like the data type and expected amount of data. Tests are placed inside the "test" folder under the project main folder.

I have very good hands-on experience in JavaScript full-stack technologies: 

- Front-end: JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular 2.0+, GraphQL, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS/SASS
- Back-end: Node.js, REST, Firebase, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, RabbitMQ
- IaaS/PaaS: Amazon Cloud Web Services (AWS) & Google Cloud Platform
